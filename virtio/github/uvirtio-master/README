Userspace Virtio (uvirtio)
----------------------------

This project is intended to run virtio in userspace.

Userspace client parts are loaned from the KVM tool (https://github.com/penberg/linux-kvm).

Userspace server is really kernel code slightly modified to work in userspace.

Still very broken.
