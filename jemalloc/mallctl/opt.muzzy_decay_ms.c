//opt.muzzy_decay_ms (ssize_t) r-	模糊，混乱页清除时延
//	Approximate time in milliseconds from the creation of a set of unused muzzy(模糊，混乱) pages until an equivalent set of unused 
//	muzzy pages is purged (i.e. converted to clean) and/or reused. Muzzy pages are defined as previously having been 
//	unused dirty pages that were subsequently purged in a manner that left them subject to the reclamation whims of the 
//	operating system (e.g. madvise(...MADV_FREE)), and therefore in an indeterminate state. The pages are incrementally 
//	purged according to a sigmoidal decay curve that starts and ends with zero purge rate. A decay time of 0 causes all 
//	unused muzzy pages to be purged immediately upon creation. A decay time of -1 disables purging. The default decay 
//	time is 10 seconds. See arenas.muzzy_decay_ms and arena.<i>.muzzy_decay_ms for related dynamic control options.
