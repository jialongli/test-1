//opt.stats_print (bool) r-
//	Enable/disable statistics printing at exit. If enabled, the malloc_stats_print() function is called at program exit 
//	via an atexit(3) function. opt.stats_print_opts can be combined to specify output options. If --enable-stats is 
//	specified during configuration, this has the potential to cause deadlock for a multi-threaded process that exits 
//	while one or more threads are executing in the memory allocation functions. Furthermore, atexit() may allocate memory 
//	during application initialization and then deadlock internally when jemalloc in turn calls atexit(), so this option 
//	is not universally usable (though the application can register its own atexit() function with equivalent functionality
//	). Therefore, this option should only be used with care; it is primarily intended as a performance tuning aid during 
//	application development. This option is disabled by default.
