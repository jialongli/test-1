       opf
           operations and flags

       idx
           offset into the bio vector array

       rw
           binary trace for read/write request

       p_start_sect
           points to the start sector of the partition structure of the device

       bdev

       phys_segments
           number of segments in this bio after physical address coalescing is performed

       devname
           block device name

       vcnt
           bio vector count which represents number of array element (page, offset, length) which make up this
           I/O request

       ino
           i-node number of the mapped file

       flags
