NAME
       nsntrace - Perform a network trace of a process by using Linux network namespaces

SYNOPSIS
       nsntrace [options] program [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       nsntrace uses Linux network namespaces to perform network traces of the specified program. The traces are
       stored as pcap files. And can later be analyzed by applications such as wireshark.

       nsntrace creates a new network namespace and launches the specified program in it. This will ensure that
       all the packets we trace come from the system or the specified program.

       To get around the isolation caused by the network namespace a virtual network interface is created. And in
       order for the program network traffic to reach the root network namespace iptables is used.

       Since nsntrace uses iptables and traces raw sockets it needs to be run as root.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --device dev, -d dev
           The network device to use in trace.

       --outfile file, -o file
           Write the trace output to the file file. Default is nsntrace.pcap.

       --user user, -u user
           Run program with the user ID, group ID and supplementary groups of user.

       --filter filter, -f filter
           The capture filter to use while capturing. See pcap-filter(7) for filter syntax.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned; otherwise, a non-zero failure code is returned.
