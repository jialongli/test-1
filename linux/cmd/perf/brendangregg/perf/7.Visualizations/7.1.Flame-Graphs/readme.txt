Flame Graphs

CPU Flame Graph
Flame graphs are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately. They can be generated using my open source programs on github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph, which create interactive SVGs. See the Updates section for other implementations. Recently I've been helping with d3-flame-graph.

The following pages (or posts) introduce different types of flame graphs:

CPU
Memory
Off-CPU
Hot/Cold
Differential
The example on the right is a portion of a CPU flame graph, showing MySQL codepaths that are consuming CPU cycles, and by how much.

Summary
The x-axis shows the stack profile population, sorted alphabetically (it is not the passage of time), and the y-axis shows stack depth, counting from zero at the bottom. Each rectangle represents a stack frame. The wider a frame is is, the more often it was present in the stacks. The top edge shows what is on-CPU, and beneath it is its ancestry. The colors are usually not significant, picked randomly to differentiate frames.

This visualization is fully explained in my ACMQ article The Flame Graph, also published in Communications of the ACM, Vol. 59 No. 6.

Also see my CPU Flame Graphs page, and the presentation below.

Operating Systems
Flame graphs can be generated from any profile data that contains stack traces, including from the following profiling tools:

Linux: perf, eBPF, SystemTap, and ktap
Solaris, illumos, FreeBSD: DTrace
Mac OS X: DTrace and Instruments
Windows: Xperf.exe
Once you have a profiler that can generate meaningful stacks, converting them into a flame graph is usually the easy step.

Presentation
I gave an updated talk explaining flame graphs at USENIX ATC 2017 titled Visualizing Performance with Flame Graphs, which is on youtube and slideshare (PDF)

 

My first talk on flame graphs was at USENIX LISA 2013, which ended up as a plenary talk (youtube, slideshare, PDF):

Variations
Icicle charts are flame graphs upside down. Some people prefer it that way. My flamegraph.pl creates them using --inverted. I prefer the standard "flame" layout, where the y-axis is counting stack depth upwards from zero at the bottom. With icicle charts, the y-axis has zero at the top, and counts downwards, which I find odd (I'm used to line charts with a 0,0 origin in the bottom left). I'm also used to scanning them top-down to look for plateaus. But other developers are always reading root-to-leaf, and the icicle layout (with a GUI that starts at the top) means their starting point is always on the screen, and they don't need to scroll first.

Flame charts were first added by Google Chrome's WebKit Web Inspector (bug). While inspired by flame graphs, flame charts put the passage of time on the x-axis instead of the alphabet. This means that time-based patterns can studied. Flame graphs reorder the x-axis samples alphabetically, which maximizes frame merging, and better shows the big picture of the profile. Multi-threaded applications can't be shown sensibly by a single flame chart, whereas they can with a flame graphs (a problem flame charts didn't need to deal with, since it was initially used for single-threaded JavaScript analysis). Both visualizations are useful, and tools should make both available if possible (e.g., TraceCompass does). Some analysis tools have implemented flame charts and mistakingly called them flame graphs.

Sunburst layout using radial coordinates for the x-axis, a flame graph can be turned into a hierarchical pie chart. The Google Web Inspector team prototyped them.

Origin
I invented flame graphs when working on a MySQL performance issue and needed to understand CPU usage quickly and in depth. The regular profilers/tracers had produced walls of text, so I was exploring visualizations. I first traced CPU function calls and visualized it using Neelakanth Nadgir's time-ordered visualization for callstacks, which itself was inspired by Roch Bourbonnais's CallStackAnalyzer and Jan Boerhout's vftrace. These look similar to flame graphs, but have the passage of time on the x-axis. But there were two problems: the overhead of function tracing was too high, perturbing the target, and the final visualization was too dense to read when spanning multiple seconds. I switched to timed sampling (profiling) to solve the overhead problem, but since the function flow is no longer known (sampling has gaps) I ditched time on the x-axis and reordered samples to maximize frame merging. It worked, the final visualization was much more readable. Neelakanth and Roch's visualizations used completely random colors to differentiate frames. I thought it looked nicer to narrow the color palette, and picked just warm colors initially as it explained why the CPUs were "hot" (busy). Since it resembled flames, it quickly became known as flame graphs.

I described more detail of the original performance problem that led to flame graphs in my ACMQ/CACM article (link above). The flame graph visualization is really an adjacency diagram with an inverted icicle layout, which I used to visualize profiled stack traces.

Updates
Flame graphs were released in Dec 2011. Not long afterwards (updated in 2012):

Alan Coopersmith generated flame graphs of the X server.
Dave Pacheco created them with node.js functions.
Max Bruning has also shown how he used it to solve an IP scaling issue.
Dave Pacheco has also created stackvis, a Node.js implementation, available on npm.
