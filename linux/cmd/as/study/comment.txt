Comments
There are two ways of rendering comments to as. In both cases the comment is equivalent
to one space.
Anything from ‘/*’ through the next ‘*/’ is a comment. This means you may not nest
these comments.
/*
   The only way to include a newline (’\n’) in a comment
   is to use this sort of comment.
   */
/* This sort of comment does not nest. */

‘#’ on the i386 and x86-64;

# This is an ordinary comment.
# 42-6 "new_file_name" # New logical file name
# This is logical line # 36.
