NAME
       powertop - a power consumption and power management diagnosis tool.

SYNOPSIS
       powertop [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       powertop  is a program that helps to diagnose various issues with power consumption and power management.
       It also has an interactive mode allowing one to experiment with various power management  settings.  When
       invoking powertop without arguments powertop starts in interactive mode.

OPTIONS
       --auto-tune
              Set all tunable options to their good setting without interaction.

       -c, --calibrate
              runs  powertop  in calibration mode. When running on battery, powertop can track power consumption
              as well as system activity. When there are enough measurements, powertop can start to report power
              estimates. One can get more accurate estimates by using this option to enable a calibration cycle.
              This will cycle through various display levels and USB device activities and workloads.

       -C[FILENAME], --csv[=FILENAME]
              generate a CSV report. If a filename is not specified then  the  default  name  "powertop.csv"  is
              used.  If  filename is "-" then STDOUT is used.  The CSV report can be used for reporting and data
              analysis.

       -d[FILENAME], --dump[=FILENAME]
              generate a plain text report. If a filename is not specified or it is "-" then STDOUT is used.

       --debug
               run in "debug" mode.

       --extech=devnode
              use the Extech Power Analyzer for measurements. This allows one to specify the serial device  node
              of the serial to USB adaptor connecting to the Extech Power Analyzer, for example /dev/ttyUSB0.

       --help
               show the help message.

       -r[FILENAME], --html[=FILENAME]
              generate  an  HTML report. If a filename is not specified then the default name "powertop.html" is
              used. If filename is "-" then STDOUT is used.  The HTML report can be sent to others to help diag‚Äê
              nose power issues.

       --iteration[=iterations]
              number of times to run each test.

       --workload[=workload]
              file to execute for workload.

       --quiet
               supress stderr output.

       --time[=seconds]
              generate a report for a specified number of seconds.

       --version
              print version information and exit.
