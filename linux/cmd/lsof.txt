'lsof' Program
The name lsof stands for "list open files." Like tcpdump, it is a publicly available tool that is handy for debugging and has been ported to many versions of Unix.
One common use for lsof with networking is to find which process has a socket open on a specified IP address or port. netstat tells us which IP addresses and ports are in use, and the state of the TCP connections, but it does not identify the process. For example, to find out which process provides the daytime server, we execute the following:

freebsd % lsof -i TCP:daytime
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
inetd 561 root 5u IPv4 0xfffff8003027a260 0t0 TCP *:daytime (LISTEN)
	inetd 561 root 7u IPv6 0xfffff800302b6720 0t0 TCP *:daytime
