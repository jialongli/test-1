NAME
       cyclictest - High resolution test program

SYNOPSIS
       cyclictest  [  -hfmnqrsvMS ] [-a proc ] [-A align ] [-b usec ] [-c clock ] [-d dist ] [-h histogram ] [-i
       intv ] [-l loop ] [-o red ] [-p prio ] [-t num ] [-D time] [-w] [-W] [-y policy ] [ -S | -U ]


OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with  long  options  starting  with  two  dashes
       ('--').
       A summary of options is included below.

       -a, --affinity[=PROC-SET]
              Run threads on the set of processors given by PROC-SET.  If PROC-SET is not specified, all proces‐
              sors will be used.  Threads will be assigned to processors in the  set  in  numeric  order,  in  a
              round-robin fashion.
              The  set of processors can be specified as A,B,C, or A-C, or A-B,D-F, and so on*.  The ! character
              can be used to negate a set.  For example, !B-D means to use all available CPUs except  B  through
              D.   The  cpu  numbers are the same as shown in the processor field in /proc/cpuinfo.  See numa(3)
              for more information on specifying CPU sets.  * Support for CPU sets requires libnuma  version  >=
              2.  For libnuma v1, PROC-SET, if specified, must be a single CPU number.

       -A, --align=USEC
              Align thread wakeups to a specific offset in microseconds

       -b, --breaktrace=USEC
              Send break trace command when latency > USEC

       -B, --preemptirqs
              Both preempt and irqsoff tracing (used with -b)

       -c, --clock=CLOCK
              select clock
              0 = CLOCK_MONOTONIC (default)
              1 = CLOCK_REALTIME

       -C, --context
              context switch tracing (used with -b)

       -d, --distance=DIST
              Distance of thread intervals in us, default = 500

       -D, --duration=TIME
              Specify a length for the test run.
              Append 'm', 'h', or 'd' to specify minutes, hours or days.

       -E, --event
              event tracing (used with -b)

       -f, --ftrace
              Enable function tracing using ftrace as tracer. This option is available only with -b.

       -F, --fifo=<path>
              Create a named pipe at path and write stats to it

       -h, --histogram=US
              Dump  latency  histogram  to  stdout after the run. US is the max latency time to be be tracked in
              microseconds. This option runs all threads at the same priority.

       -H, --histofall=MAXLATENCYINUS
              Same as -h except that an additional histogram column is displayed at the right that contains sum‐
              mary  data  of  all  thread  histograms. If cyclictest runs a single thread only, the -H option is
              equivalent to -h.

       --histfile=<path>
              Dump the latency histogram to <path> instead of stdout.

       -i, --interval=INTV
              Set the base interval of the thread(s) in microseconds (default is 1000us). This sets the interval
              of the first thread. See also -d.

       -I, --irqsoff
              Irgsoff tracing (used with -b)

       -l, --loops=LOOPS
              Set  the  number  of  loops. The default is 0 (endless). This option is useful for automated tests
              with a given number of test cycles. Cyclictest is stopped once the number of timer  intervals  has
              been reached.

       --laptop
              Save  battery  when  running  cyclictest. This will give you poorer realtime results, but will not
              drain your battery so quickly.

       -m, --mlockall
              Lock current and future memory allocations to prevent being paged out

       -M, --refresh_on_max
              Delay updating the screen until a new max latency is hit. (useful for running cyclictest  on  low-
              bandwidth connections)

       -n, --nanosleep
              Use  clock_nanosleep  instead  of  posix  interval timers. Setting this option runs the tests with
              clock_nanosleep instead of posix interval timers.

       --notrace
              suppress tracing

       -N, --nsecs
              Show results in nanoseconds instead of microseconds, which is the default unit.

       -o, --oscope=RED
              Oscilloscope mode, reduce verbose output by RED.

       -O, --traceopt=TRACING_OPTION
              Used to pass tracing options to ftrace tracers. May be invoked multiple times for  multiple  trace
              options. For example trace options look at /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_options

       -p, --prio=PRIO
              Set  the  priority  of  the first thread. The given priority is set to the first test thread. Each
              further thread gets a lower priority: Priority(Thread N) = max(Priority(Thread N-1) - 1, 0)

       -P, --preemptoff
              Preempt off tracing (used with -b)

       --policy=NAME
              set the scheduler policy of the measurement threads where NAME is one of:  other,  normal,  batch,
              idle, fifo, rr

       --priospread
              spread priority levels starting at a specified value

       -q, --quiet
              Print  a  summary only on exit. Useful for automated tests, where only the summary output needs to
              be captured.

       -r, --relative
              Use relative timers instead of absolute. The default behaviour of the tests  is  to  use  absolute
              timers. This option is there for completeness and should not be used for reproducible tests.

       -R, --resolution
              Check  clock resolution, calling clock_gettime() many times. List of lock_gettime() values will be
              reported with -X

       --secaligned [USEC]
              align thread wakeups to the next full second and apply the optional offset.

       -s, --system
              Use sys_nanosleep and sys_setitimer instead of posix timers. Note, that -s can only be  used  with
              one  thread because itimers are per process and not per thread. -s in combination with -n uses the
              nanosleep syscall and is not restricted to one thread.

       -S, --smp
              Set options for standard testing on SMP systems. Equivalent to using the options: "-t  -a  -n"  as
              well keeping any specified priority equal across all threads

       --spike=<trigger>
              record all spikes > trigger

       --spike-nodes=[num of nodes]
              These are the maximum number of spikes we can record.
              The default is 1024 if not specified.

       --smi  Enable SMI count/detection on processors with SMI count support.

       -t, --threads[=NUM]
              Set  the  number of test threads (default is 1). Create NUM test threads. If NUM is not specified,
              NUM is set to the number of available CPUs. See -d, -i and -p for further information.

       --tracemark
              write a trace mark when -b latency is exceeded.

       -T, --tracer=TRACEFUNC
              set the ftrace tracer function. Used with the -b option. Must be one of the trace functions avail‐
              able from <debugfs-mountpoint>/kernel/debug/tracing/available_tracers

       -u, --unbuffered
              force unbuffered output for live processing

       -U, --numa
              Standard NUMA testing (similar to SMP option) thread data structures allocated from local node.

       -v, --verbose
              Output  values  on  stdout  for  statistics. This option is used to gather statistical information
              about the latency distribution. The output is sent to stdout. The output format is:

              n:c:v

              where n=task number c=count v=latency value in us.

       -w, --wakeup
              task wakeup tracing (used with -b)

       -W, --wakeuprt
              rt-task wakeup tracing (used with -b)

       --dbg_cyclictest
              Print info userful for debugging cyclictest
