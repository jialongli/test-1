RTEVAL(8)                                    System Manager's Manual                                   RTEVAL(8)



NAME
       rteval - evaluate latency performance of a realtime Linux system

SYNOPSIS
       rteval [ -hvsLSDOZ ] [-d duration ] [-w workdir ] [-l loaddir ] [-X host ]


       The  rteval program is used to evaluate the realtime performance of a realtime Linux kernel on a particu‐
       lar hardware system. There is nothing that actually requires a realtime Linux  kernel,  but  the  latency
       measurements will usually be pretty bad on a stock Linux kernel.



OPTIONS
       These  programs  follow  the  usual  GNU  command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes
       ('--').
       A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              print a help message

       -d, --duration=DURATION
              Specify the length of the measurement run. DURATION is an integer with an optional suffix indicat‐
              ing the units:

                 s - seconds
                 m - minutes
                 h - hours
                 d - days
              for example to execute a ten minute run of rteval:
                   $ rteval --duration=10m

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the verbosity of output during the test run

       -w, --workdir=WORKDIR
              Tell  rteval  to  change directory to WORKDIR before creating any subdirectories for report files.
              The default WORKDIR is the directory in which rteval was started.

       -l, --loaddir=LOADDIR
              Tell rteval where to find the source for the loads

       --loads-cpulist=CPULIST
              List of CPUs where loads will run

       --measurement-cpulist=CPULIST
              List of CPUs where measurement applciation will run

       -s, --sysreport
              Have rteval run the sysreport utility after a run to gather information on the running system.

       -D, --debug
              Turn on debugging prints during run

       -X, --xmprpc-submit=HOST
              Have rteval send report data to HOST following the run, using XML-RPC

       -Z, --summarize
              Have rteval summarize an existing report. This will not cause loads or meausurement  utilities  to
              be run.


FILES
       rteval-YYYYMMDD-S  This  is  a  directory created by rteval to hold the summary.xml file as well as other
       files collected on the system. It is the current Year, Month, and Day, followed by a sequence number  for
       multiple runs on the same day.

       summary.xml This is an XML file that contains information about a test run and the host system upon which
       rteval was run.  dmesg This is the output of the dmesg(1) program immediately following system  boot.  It
       is copied from /var/log/dmesg.
