NAME
       cyclicdeadline  - This program is used to test the deadline scheduler (SCHED_DEADLINE) using a cyclictest

SYNOPSIS
       cyclicdeadline [-a [CPUSET]] [-D TIME] [-h]  [-i INTV] [-s STEP] [-t NUM] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
       cyclicdeadline is a cyclictest style program for testing the deadline scheduler

OPTIONS
       -a --affinity [CPUSET]
              Comma / hypen separated list of CPUs to run deadline tasks on

       -D --duration TIME
              Specify a length for the test to run Append 'm', 'h', or 'd' to specify minutes, hours, or days

       -h --help
              Show this help menu

       -i --interval INTV
              The shortest deadline for the tasks in us. (default 1000us)

       -s --step STEP
              The amount to increase the deadline for each task in us. (default 500us)

       -t --threads NUM
              The number of threads to run as deadline (default 1)

       -q, --quiet
