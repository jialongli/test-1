Three Thread-Local Storage (TLS) segments: this is a mechanism that allows multithreaded
applications to make use of up to three segments containing data local to each thread. The
set_thread_area( ) and get_thread_area( ) system calls, respectively, create and release a
TLS segment for the executing process.
