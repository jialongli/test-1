       -r repeat      Execute specified command N times.

       -i interval    When -r is used, waits interval seconds per command.  It is possible to specify sub-sec‐
                      ond times like -i 0.1.

       -n db          Database number.

       -x             Read last argument from STDIN.

       -d delimiter   Multi-bulk delimiter in for raw formatting (default: 0.

       -c             Enable cluster mode (follow -ASK and -MOVED redirections).

       --raw          Use raw formatting for replies (default when STDOUT is not a tty).

       --stat         Print rolling stats about server: mem, clients, ...

       --latency      Enter a special mode continuously sampling latency.

       --latency-history
                      Like --latency but tracking latency changes over time.  Default time interval is 15 sec.
                      Change it using -i.

       --latency-dist Shows latency as a spectrum, requires xterm 256 colors.  Default time interval is 1 sec.
                      Change it using -i.

       --lru-test     Simulate a cache workload with an 80-20 distribution.

       --slave        Simulate a slave showing commands received from the master.

       --rdb filename Transfer an RDB dump from remote server to local file.

       --pipe         Transfer raw Redis protocol from stdin to server.

       --scan         List all keys using the SCAN command.

       --pattern pat  Useful with --scan to specify a SCAN pattern.

       --intrinsic-latency sec
                      Run a test to measure intrinsic system latency.  The test will  run  for  the  specified

       cat /etc/passwd | redis-cli -x set mypasswd

       redis-cli get mypasswd

       redis-cli -r 100 -i 1 info | grep used_memory_human:

       redis-cli --eval myscript.lua key1 key2 , arg1 arg2 arg3

       redis-cli --scan --pattern '*:12345*'
