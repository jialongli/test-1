/* redisassert.h -- Drop in replacements assert.h that prints the stack trace
 *                  in the Redis logs.
 *
 * This file should be included instead of "assert.h" inside libraries used by
 * Redis that are using assertions, so instead of Redis disappearing with
 * SIGABORT, we get the details and stack trace inside the log file.
