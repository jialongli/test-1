NAME
       nload - displays the current network usage


SYNOPSIS
       nload  [-a  period]  [-i  max_scaling]  [-m]  [-o max_scaling] [-t interval] [-u h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G] [-U
       h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G] [devices]

       nload --help|-h


DESCRIPTION
       nload is a console application which monitors network traffic and bandwidth usage in real time.  It visu‐
       alizes  the  in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides additional info like the total amount
       of transfered data and min/max network usage.


USAGE
       When running nload, you can switch between the devices (which you gave nload either on the  command  line
       or  which were auto-detected) by pressing the left and right arrow keys. If the -m command line parameter
       is given, the arrow keys switch as many devices back and forth as there are shown on the screen.  If  you
       want to quit, do so by pressing 'q' or 'Ctrl+C'.

       For further key shortcuts, have a look at the sections MAIN WINDOW and OPTION WINDOW below.


OPTIONS
       A summary of the options supported by nload is included below.


       -a period
              Sets the length in seconds of the time window for average calculation.  The default is 300.

       -i max_scaling
              Specifies  the  100% mark in kBit/s of the graph indicating the incoming bandwidth usage.  Ignored
              if max_scaling is 0 or the switch -m is given. The default value for max_scaling is 10240.

       -m     Show multiple devices at a time; do not show the traffic graphs.

       -o max_scaling
              Same as -i but for the graph indicating the outgoing bandwidth usage.

       -t interval
              Determines the refresh interval of the display in milliseconds.  The default value of interval  is
              500.

              PLEASE NOTE: Specifying refresh intervals shorter than about 100 milliseconds makes traffic calcu‐
              lation very unprecise. Also the display may flicker using such  short  refresh  intervals.   nload
              tries to balance this out by doing extra time measurements, but this may not always succeed.

       -u h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G
              Sets  the  type of unit used for the display of traffic numbers.  h means human readable (auto), b
              Bit/s, k kBit/s, m MBit/s and g GBit/s.  The upper case letters mean the  corresponding  units  in
              Bytes (instead of Bits).  The default is k.

       -U h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G
              Same  as -u, but for an amount of data, e.g. Bit, kByte, GBit etc. (without "/s").  The default is
              M.

       devices
              Network devices to use. The default is "all", which means to display all auto-detected devices.

       -h, --help
              Show a short summary of these command line options.


MAIN WINDOW
       After starting, nload begins to monitor the network devices given on the command line, or, if none  where
       specified, the default device. In this mode, the following key shortcuts are available.


       'ArrowRight', 'ArrowDown', 'PageDown', 'Enter', 'Tab'
              Switch the display to the next network device, or, when started with the -m flag, to the next page
              of devices.


       'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowUp', 'PageUp'
              Switch the display to the previous network device, or, when started with the -m flag, to the  pre‐
              vious page of devices.


       'F2'   Show the option window (see section OPTION WINDOW below).


       'F5'   Save current settings to the user's config file.


       'F6'   Reload settings from the config files.


       'q', 'Ctrl+C'
              Quit nload.


OPTION WINDOW
       The  parameters  given  to nload on the command line can be adjusted during run time by pressing the 'F2'
       key. A small window appears on the top of the screen, listing the available settings.


       'F2'   Show/hide the option window.


       'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight', 'Home', 'End'
              Navigate within the edit fields.


       'ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'Enter'
              Navigate between the settings.


       'PageUp', 'PageDown', 'Tab'
              Toggle between the different values possible for the current field.


       '+' / '-'
              Switch to the next / previous page of settings.


FILES
       /etc/nload.conf
              System-wide configuration file.


       $(HOME)/.nload
              User-specific configuration file (overrides system-wide settings).


       /sys/class/net/*/* /proc/net/dev
              are read by nload when running on Linux to get the network traffic data.
