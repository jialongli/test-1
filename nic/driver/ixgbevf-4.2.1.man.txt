NAME
       ixgbevf -This file describes the Linux* Base Driver for the Gigabit Family of Adapters.

SYNOPSIS
       modprobe ixgbevf [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  driver  is  intended for 2.6.x or later kernels.  This driver includes support for any 64 bit Linux
       supported system, including Itanium(R)2, x86_64, PPC64,ARM, etc.


       This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not supplying  patches  against
       the kernel source to allow for static linking of the drivers.

       A version of the driver may already be included by your distribution and/or the kernel.org kernel.




       For  questions  related  to  hardware  requirements,  refer to the documentation supplied with your Intel
       adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to use with Linux.

       InterruptThrottleRate

              Valid Range: 0=off 1=dynamic <min_ITR>-<max_ITR>

              Interrupt Throttle Rate controls the number of interrupts each interrupt vector can  generate  per
              second. Increasing ITR lowers latency at the cost of increased CPU utilization, though it may help
              throughput in some circumstances.

              0 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to 0 turns off any interrupt moderation
                and may improve small packet latency. However, this is generally not
                suitable for bulk throughput traffic due to the increased CPU utilization
                of the higher interrupt rate.
                NOTES:
                - On 82599, and X540, and X550-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate
                  will also result in the driver disabling HW RSC.
                - On 82598-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate will also
                  result in disabling LRO (Large Receive Offloads).

              1 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to Dynamic mode attempts to moderate
                interrupts per vector while maintaining very low latency. This can
                sometimes cause extra CPU utilization. If planning on deploying ixgbevf
                in a latency sensitive environment, this parameter should be considered.

              <min_ITR>-<max_ITR> = 956-488281
                Setting InterruptThrottleRate to a value greater or equal to <min_ITR>
                will program the adapter to send at most that many interrupts
                per second, even if more packets have come in. This reduces interrupt load
                on the system and can lower CPU utilization under heavy load, but will
                increase latency as packets are not processed as quickly.


ethtool
       The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and diagnostics, as well as displaying
       statistical  information.  The  latest ethtool version is required for this functionality. Download it at
       http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/



SUPPORT
       For additional information regarding building and installation, see the README included with the  driver.
       For general information, go to the Intel support website at: www.intel.com/support/

       If  an  issue is identified with the released source code on a supported kernel with a supported adapter,
       email the specific information related to the issue to e1000-devel@lists.sf.net.
