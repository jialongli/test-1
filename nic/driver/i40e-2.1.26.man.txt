NAME
       i40e  -This  file describes the Linux* Base Driver for the Intel Ethernet Controller XL710 Family of Con‚Äê
       trollers.

SYNOPSIS
       modprobe i40e [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

DESCRIPTION
       This driver is intended for 2.6.32 and newer kernels.  This driver includes support for any 64 bit  Linux
       supported system, including Itanium(R)2, x86_64, PPC64,ARM, etc.


       This  driver  is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not supplying patches against
       the kernel source to allow for static linking of the drivers.



       For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to  the  documentation  supplied  with  your  Intel
       adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to use with Linux.

Jumbo Frames
       Jumbo  Frames  support  is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to a value larger than
       the default value of 1500.

       Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the  following  where  <x>  is  the
       interface number:

          ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up Alternatively, you can use the ip command as follows:
          ip link set mtu 9000 dev eth<x>
          ip link set up dev eth<x>


       NOTES: - The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 9702. This value coincides
         with  the  maximum  Jumbo  Frames  size of 9728 bytes.  - This driver will attempt to use multiple page
       sized buffers to receive
         each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues
         when allocating receive packets.

       See the section "Jumbo Frames" in the Readme.

SUPPORT
       For additional information regarding building and installation, see the README included with the  driver.
       For general information, go to the Intel support website at: www.intel.com/support/

       If  an  issue is identified with the released source code on a supported kernel with a supported adapter,
       email the specific information related to the issue to e1000-devel@lists.sf.net.
