/**
 * An RTE ring structure.
 *
 * The producer and the consumer have a head and a tail index. The particularity
 * of these index is that they are not between 0 and size(ring). These indexes
 * are between 0 and 2^32, and we mask their value when we access the ring[]
 * field. Thanks to this assumption, we can do subtractions between 2 index
 * values in a modulo-32bit base: that's why the overflow of the indexes is not
 * a problem.
