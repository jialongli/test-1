usage: offcputime [-h] [-p PID | -t TID | -u | -k] [-U | -K] [-d] [-f]
                  [--stack-storage-size STACK_STORAGE_SIZE]

                  [duration]

Summarize off-CPU time by stack trace

positional arguments:
  duration              duration of trace, in seconds

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PID, --pid PID     trace this PID only
  -t TID, --tid TID     trace this TID only
  -u, --user-threads-only
                        user threads only (no kernel threads)
  -k, --kernel-threads-only
                        kernel threads only (no user threads)
  -U, --user-stacks-only
                        show stacks from user space only (no kernel space
                        stacks)
  -K, --kernel-stacks-only
                        show stacks from kernel space only (no user space
                        stacks)
  -d, --delimited       insert delimiter between kernel/user stacks
  -f, --folded          output folded format
  --stack-storage-size STACK_STORAGE_SIZE
                        the number of unique stack traces that can be stored
                        and displayed (default 1024)
  -m MIN_BLOCK_TIME, --min-block-time MIN_BLOCK_TIME
                        the amount of time in microseconds over which we store
                        traces (default 1)
  -M MAX_BLOCK_TIME, --max-block-time MAX_BLOCK_TIME
                        the amount of time in microseconds under which we
                        store traces (default U64_MAX)
  --state STATE         filter on this thread state bitmask (eg, 2 ==
                        TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) see include/linux/sched.h

examples:
    ./offcputime             # trace off-CPU stack time until Ctrl-C
    ./offcputime 5           # trace for 5 seconds only
    ./offcputime -f 5        # 5 seconds, and output in folded format
    ./offcputime -m 1000     # trace only events that last more than 1000 usec
    ./offcputime -M 10000    # trace only events that last less than 10000 usec
    ./offcputime -p 185      # only trace threads for PID 185
    ./offcputime -t 188      # only trace thread 188
    ./offcputime -u          # only trace user threads (no kernel)
    ./offcputime -k          # only trace kernel threads (no user)
    ./offcputime -U          # only show user space stacks (no kernel)
    ./offcputime -K          # only show kernel space stacks (no user)
