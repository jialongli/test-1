usage: deadlock_detector [-h] [--binary BINARY] [--dump-graph DUMP_GRAPH]
                         [--verbose] [--lock-symbols LOCK_SYMBOLS]
                         [--unlock-symbols UNLOCK_SYMBOLS]
                         pid

Detect potential deadlocks (lock inversions) in a running binary.
Must be run as root.

positional arguments:
  pid                   Pid to trace

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --binary BINARY       If set, trace the mutexes from the binary at this
                        path. For statically-linked binaries, this argument is
                        not required. For dynamically-linked binaries, this
                        argument is required and should be the path of the
                        pthread library the binary is using. Example:
                        /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0
  --dump-graph DUMP_GRAPH
                        If set, this will dump the mutex graph to the
                        specified file.
  --verbose             Print statistics about the mutex wait graph.
  --lock-symbols LOCK_SYMBOLS
                        Comma-separated list of lock symbols to trace. Default
                        is pthread_mutex_lock. These symbols cannot be inlined
                        in the binary.
  --unlock-symbols UNLOCK_SYMBOLS
                        Comma-separated list of unlock symbols to trace.
                        Default is pthread_mutex_unlock. These symbols cannot
                        be inlined in the binary.

Examples:
    deadlock_detector 181        # Analyze PID 181

    deadlock_detector 181 --binary /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0
                                 # Analyze PID 181 and locks from this binary.
                                 # If tracing a process that is running from
                                 # a dynamically-linked binary, this argument
                                 # is required and should be the path to the
                                 # pthread library.

    deadlock_detector 181 --verbose
                                 # Analyze PID 181 and print statistics about
                                 # the mutex wait graph.

    deadlock_detector 181 --lock-symbols my_mutex_lock1,my_mutex_lock2 \
        --unlock-symbols my_mutex_unlock1,my_mutex_unlock2
                                 # Analyze PID 181 and trace custom mutex
                                 # symbols instead of pthread mutexes.

    deadlock_detector 181 --dump-graph graph.json
                                 # Analyze PID 181 and dump the mutex wait
                                 # graph to graph.json.
