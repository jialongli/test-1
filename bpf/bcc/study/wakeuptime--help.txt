usage: wakeuptime [-h] [-u] [-p PID] [-v] [-f]
                  [--stack-storage-size STACK_STORAGE_SIZE]
                  [-m MIN_BLOCK_TIME] [-M MAX_BLOCK_TIME]
                  [duration]

Summarize sleep to wakeup time by waker kernel stack

positional arguments:
  duration              duration of trace, in seconds

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --useronly        user threads only (no kernel threads)
  -p PID, --pid PID     trace this PID only
  -v, --verbose         show raw addresses
  -f, --folded          output folded format
  --stack-storage-size STACK_STORAGE_SIZE
                        the number of unique stack traces that can be stored
                        and displayed (default 1024)
  -m MIN_BLOCK_TIME, --min-block-time MIN_BLOCK_TIME
                        the amount of time in microseconds over which we store
                        traces (default 1)
  -M MAX_BLOCK_TIME, --max-block-time MAX_BLOCK_TIME
                        the amount of time in microseconds under which we
                        store traces (default U64_MAX)

examples:
    ./wakeuptime             # trace blocked time with waker stacks
    ./wakeuptime 5           # trace for 5 seconds only
    ./wakeuptime -f 5        # 5 seconds, and output in folded format
    ./wakeuptime -u          # don't include kernel threads (user only)
    ./wakeuptime -p 185      # trace for PID 185 only
