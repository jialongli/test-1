GCC looks in several diﬀerent places for headers. On a normal Unix system, if you do not
instruct it otherwise, it will look for headers requested with #include <file> in:
/usr/local/include
libdir/gcc/target/version/include
/usr/target/include
/usr/include
For C++ programs, it will also look in ‘/usr/include/g++-v3’, frst. In the above, target
is the canonical name of the system GCC was confgured to compile code for; often but not
always the same as the canonical name of the system it runs on. version is the version of
GCC in use.
You can add to this list with the ‘-Idir’ command line option. All the directories named
by ‘-I’ are searched, in left-to-right order, before the default directories. The only exception
is when ‘dir’ is already searched by default. In this case, the option is ignored and the
search order for system directories remains unchanged.
Duplicate directories are removed from the quote and bracket search chains before the
two chains are merged to make the fnal search chain. Thus, it is possible for a directory to
occur twice in the fnal search chain if it was specifed in both the quote and bracket chains.
You can prevent GCC from searching any of the default directories with the ‘-nostdinc’
option. This is useful when you are compiling an operating system kernel or some other
program that does not use the standard C library facilities, or the standard C library itself.
‘-I’ options are not ignored as described above when ‘-nostdinc’ is in eﬀect.
GCC looks for headers requested with #include "file" frst in the directory containing
the current fle, then in the directories as specifed by ‘-iquote’ options, then in the same
places it would have looked for a header requested with angle brackets. For example, if
‘/usr/include/sys/stat.h’ contains #include "types.h", GCC looks for ‘types.h’ frst
in ‘/usr/include/sys’, then in its usual search path.
‘#line’ (see Chapter 6 [Line Control], page 43) does not change GCC’s idea of the
directory containing the current fle.
You may put ‘-I-’ at any point in your list of ‘-I’ options. This has two eﬀects. First,
directories appearing before the ‘-I-’ in the list are searched only for headers requested
with quote marks. Directories after ‘-I-’ are searched for all headers. Second, the directory
containing the current fle is not searched for anything, unless it happens to be one of the
directories named by an ‘-I’ switch. ‘-I-’ is deprecated, ‘-iquote’ should be used instead.
‘-I. -I-’ is not the same as no ‘-I’ options at all, and does not cause the same behavior
for ‘<>’ includes that ‘""’ includes get with no special options. ‘-I.’ searches the compiler’s
current working directory for header fles. That may or may not be the same as the directory
containing the current fle.
If you need to look for headers in a directory named ‘-’, write ‘-I./-’.
There are several more ways to adjust the header search path. They are generally less
useful. See Chapter 12 [Invocation], page 55.
