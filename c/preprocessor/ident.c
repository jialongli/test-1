/*
 *	8 Other Directives
 *	The ‘#ident’ directive takes one argument, a string constant. On some systems, that string
 *	constant is copied into a special segment of the object fle. On other systems, the directive
 *	is ignored. The ‘#sccs’ directive is a synonym for ‘#ident’.
 *	These directives are not part of the C standard, but they are not ofcial GNU extensions
 *	either. What historical information we have been able to fnd, suggests they originated with
 *	System V.
 *	The null directive consists of a ‘#’ followed by a newline, with only whitespace (including
 *	comments) in between. A null directive is understood as a preprocessing directive but has
 *	no eﬀect on the preprocessor output. The primary signifcance of the existence of the null
 *	directive is that an input line consisting of just a ‘#’ will produce no output, rather than a
 *	line of output containing just a ‘#’. Supposedly some old C programs contain such lines.
