PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_close, posix_trace_open, posix_trace_rewind - trace log management (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_close(trace_id_t trid);
       int posix_trace_open(int file_desc, trace_id_t *trid);
       int posix_trace_rewind(trace_id_t trid);


DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_trace_close() function shall deallocate the trace log identifier indicated by trid, and all of
       its associated resources. If there is no valid trace log pointed to by  the  trid,  this  function  shall
       fail.

       The  posix_trace_open()  function  shall  allocate  the  necessary resources and establish the connection
       between a trace log identified by the file_desc argument and a trace stream identifier identified by  the
       object  pointed  to  by  the trid argument. The file_desc argument should be a valid open file descriptor
       that corresponds to a trace log. The file_desc argument shall be open  for  reading.  The  current  trace
       event  timestamp,  which specifies the timestamp of the trace event that will be read by the next call to
       posix_trace_getnext_event(), shall be set to the timestamp of the oldest  trace  event  recorded  in  the
       trace log identified by trid.

       The  posix_trace_open() function shall return a trace stream identifier in the variable pointed to by the
       trid argument, that may only be used by the following functions:

                   posix_trace_close()                       posix_trace_get_attr()
                   posix_trace_eventid_equal()               posix_trace_get_status()
                   posix_trace_eventid_get_name()            posix_trace_getnext_event()
                   posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id()    posix_trace_rewind()
                   posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind()


       In particular, notice that  the  operations  normally  used  by  a  trace  controller  process,  such  as
       posix_trace_start(),  posix_trace_stop(),  or  posix_trace_shutdown(),  cannot be invoked using the trace
       stream identifier returned by the posix_trace_open() function.

       The posix_trace_rewind() function shall reset the current trace  event  timestamp,  which  specifies  the
       timestamp  of  the  trace event that will be read by the next call to posix_trace_getnext_event(), to the
       timestamp of the oldest trace event recorded in the trace log identified by trid.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value of zero. Otherwise,  they  shall  return
       the corresponding error number.

       If  successful,  the  posix_trace_open()  function stores the trace stream identifier value in the object
       pointed to by trid.

ERRORS
       The posix_trace_open() function shall fail if:

       EINTR  The operation was interrupted by a signal and thus no trace log was opened.

       EINVAL The object pointed to by file_desc does not correspond to a valid trace log.


       The posix_trace_close() and posix_trace_rewind() functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The object pointed to by trid does not correspond to a valid trace log.
