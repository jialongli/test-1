PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_barrierattr_getpshared, pthread_barrierattr_setpshared - get and set the process-shared attribute
       of the barrier attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>



       int pthread_barrierattr_getpshared(const pthread_barrierattr_t *
              restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_barrierattr_setpshared(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr,
              int pshared);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value of the process-shared attribute from
       the  attributes  object  referenced  by attr. The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function shall set the
       process-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.

       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a barrier to be operated upon  by
       any  thread that has access to the memory where the barrier is allocated. If the process-shared attribute
       is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the barrier shall only be operated upon by threads created  within  the  same
       process  as the thread that initialized the barrier; if threads of different processes attempt to operate
       on  such  a  barrier,  the  behavior  is  undefined.  The  default  value  of  the  attribute  shall   be
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE. Both constants PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED and PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE are defined in
       <pthread.h>.

       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the associated functions  to  get  and  set
       those attribute values are implementation-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() function shall return zero and store the value of the
       process-shared attribute of attr into the object referenced by the pshared parameter. Otherwise, an error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       If  successful, the pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error num‐
       ber shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The new value specified  for  the  process-shared  attribute  is  not  one  of  the  legal  values
              PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED or PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() and pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() functions are part of the Bar‐
       riers option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
