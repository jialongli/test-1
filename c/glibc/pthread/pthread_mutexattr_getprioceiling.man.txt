PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPRIOCEILING(3P)        POSIX Programmer's Manual       PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPRIOCEILING(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling,   pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling   -  get  and  set  the  prioceiling
       attribute of the mutex attributes object (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling(const pthread_mutexattr_t *
              restrict attr, int *restrict prioceiling);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
              int prioceiling);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and  pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling()  functions,  respectively,
       shall  get  and  set the priority ceiling attribute of a mutex attributes object pointed to by attr which
       was previously created by the function pthread_mutexattr_init().

       The prioceiling attribute contains the priority ceiling of initialized mutexes. The values of prioceiling
       are within the maximum range of priorities defined by SCHED_FIFO.

       The  prioceiling attribute defines the priority ceiling of initialized mutexes, which is the minimum pri‐
       ority level at which the critical section guarded by the mutex is executed. In order  to  avoid  priority
       inversion, the priority ceiling of the mutex shall be set to a priority higher than or equal to the high‐
       est priority of all the threads that may lock that mutex. The values of prioceiling are within the  maxi‐
       mum range of priorities defined under the SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy.

		pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling（）和pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling（）函数应分别获取并设置attr所指
		向的互斥对象的优先级上限属性，该对象先前是由函数pthread_mutexattr_init（）创建的。

		prioceiling属性包含初始化互斥的优先级上限。 封顶的值在SCHED_FIFO定义的最大优先级范围内。


		prioceiling属性定义了已初始化互斥锁的优先级上限，这是执行互斥锁保护的关键部分的最低优先级。 
		为了避免优先级倒置，互斥锁的优先级上限应设置为高于或等于可能锁定该互斥锁的所有线程的最高优先级的优先级。 
		封顶的值在SCHED_FIFO调度策略定义的最大优先级范围内。


RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling()
       functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling() functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr or prioceiling is invalid.

       EPERM  The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
