PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_DESTROY(3P)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_DESTROY(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_barrierattr_destroy,  pthread_barrierattr_init  -  destroy  and initialize the barrier attributes
       object (ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_barrierattr_destroy(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_barrierattr_init(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_barrierattr_destroy() function shall destroy a barrier attributes object.  A  destroyed  attr
       attributes  object can be reinitialized using pthread_barrierattr_init(); the results of otherwise refer‐
       encing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An implementation may cause pthread_barrier‐
       attr_destroy() to set the object referenced by attr to an invalid value.

       The  pthread_barrierattr_init()  function  shall  initialize  a  barrier  attributes object attr with the
       default value for all of the attributes defined by the implementation.

       Results are undefined if pthread_barrierattr_init() is called  specifying  an  already  initialized  attr
       attributes object.

       After  a barrier attributes object has been used to initialize one or more barriers, any function affect‐
       ing the attributes object (including destruction) shall not affect any previously initialized barrier.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_barrierattr_destroy() and pthread_barrierattr_init()  functions  shall  return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_barrierattr_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_barrierattr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the barrier attributes object.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  pthread_barrierattr_destroy()  and  pthread_barrierattr_init()  functions  are  part of the Barriers
       option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
