GETHUGEPAGESIZES(3)                   Library Functions Manual                   GETHUGEPAGESIZES(3)



NAME
       gethugepagesizes - Get the system supported huge page sizes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <hugetlbfs.h>

       int gethugepagesizes(long pagesizes[], int n_elem);


DESCRIPTION
       The gethugepagesizes() function returns either the number of system supported huge page sizes
       or the sizes  themselves. If pagesizes is NULL and n_elem is 0, then the number of huge pages
       the  system  supports  is  returned.  Otherwise, pagesizes is filled with at most n_elem page
       sizes.


RETURN VALUE
       On success, either the number of huge page sizes supported by the system  or  the  number  of
       huge  page sizes stored in pagesizes is returned. On failure, -1 is returned and errno is set
       appropriately.


ERRORS
       EINVAL n_elem is less than zero or n_elem is greater than zero and pagesizes is NULL.

       Also see opendir(3) for other possible values for errno. This error  occurs  when  the  sysfs
       directory exists but cannot be opened.


NOTES
       This  call will return all huge page sizes as reported by the kernel.  Not all of these sizes
       may be usable by the programmer since mount points may not be available for  all  sizes.   To
       test  whether  a  size  will be usable by libhugetlbfs, hugetlbfs_find_path_for_size() can be
       called on a specific size to see if a mount point is configured.
