NAME
       hugetlbfs_find_path, hugetlbfs_find_path_for_size - Locate an appropriate hugetlbfs mount point

SYNOPSIS
       #include <hugetlbfs.h>

       const char *hugetlbfs_find_path(void);
       const char *hugetlbfs_find_path_for_size(long page_size);


DESCRIPTION
       These functions return a pathname for a mounted hugetlbfs filesystem for the appropriate huge page size.  For hugetlbfs_find_path, the
       default huge page size is used (see gethugepagesize(3)).  For hugetlbfs_find_path_for_size, a valid huge page size must  be  specified
       (see gethugepagesizes(3)).


RETURN VALUE
       On success, a non-NULL value is returned.  On failure, NULL is returned.
