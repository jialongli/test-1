HUGETLBFS_UNLINKED_FD(3)                                   Library Functions Manual                                  HUGETLBFS_UNLINKED_FD(3)



NAME
       hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd, hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size - Obtain a file descriptor for a new unlinked file in hugetlbfs

SYNOPSIS
       #include <hugetlbfs.h>

       int hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd(void);
       int hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size(long page_size);


DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  return  an  open  file  descriptor  for  a  unique,  newly-created file in a hugetlbfs filesystem.  To avoid leaking
       hugepages, the file is unlinked automatically before the function returns.

       For hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd, the default huge page size is used (see gethugepagesize(3)).  For hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size,  a  valid
       huge page size must be specified (see gethugepagesizes(3)).


RETURN VALUE
       On success, a valid open file descriptor is returned.  On failure, -1 is returned and errno may be set appropriately.
