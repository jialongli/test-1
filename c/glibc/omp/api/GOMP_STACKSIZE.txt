GOMP_STACKSIZE â€“ Set default thread stack size
Description:
Set the default thread stack size in kilobytes. This is different from pthread_
attr_setstacksize which gets the number of bytes as an argument. If the
stacksize can not be set due to system constraints, an error is reported and
the initial stacksize is left unchanged. If undefined, the stack size is system
dependent.
