OMP_STACKSIZE â€“ Set default thread stack size
Description:
Set the default thread stack size in kilobytes, unless the number is suffixed by B,
	K, M or G, in which case the size is, respectively, in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or
	gigabytes. This is different from pthread_attr_setstacksize which gets the
	number of bytes as an argument. If the stacksize can not be set due to system
	constraints, an error is reported and the initial stacksize is left unchanged. If
	undefined, the stack size is system dependent.
