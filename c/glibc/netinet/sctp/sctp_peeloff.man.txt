SCTP_PEELOFF(3)                             Linux Programmer's Manual                            SCTP_PEELOFF(3)



NAME
       sctp_peeloff - Branch off an association into a separate socket.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <netinet/sctp.h>

       int sctp_peeloff(int sd, sctp_assoc_t assoc_id);

DESCRIPTION
       sctp_peeloff  branches off an existing association assoc_id on a one-to-many style socket sd into a sepa‐
       rate socket. The new socket is a one-to-one style socket.

       This is particularly desirable when, for instance, the application wishes to have a  number  of  sporadic
       message  senders/receivers remain under the original one-to-many style socket, but branch off those asso‐
       cations carrying high volume data traffic into their own separate socket descriptors.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the new socket descriptor representing the branched-off asociation is returned.  On error, -1
       is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  sd is not a valid descriptor.

       EINVAL The assoc id passed is invalid or if the socket is a one-to-one style socket.

       ENOTSOCK
              Argument is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.
