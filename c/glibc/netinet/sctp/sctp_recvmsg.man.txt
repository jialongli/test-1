NAME
       sctp_recvmsg - Receive a message from a SCTP socket.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <netinet/sctp.h>

       int sctp_recvmsg(int sd, void * msg, size_t len,
                        struct sockaddr * from, socklen_t * fromlen,
                        struct sctp_sndrcvinfo * sinfo, int * msg_flags);

DESCRIPTION
       sctp_recvmsg  is  a  wrapper  library  function that can be used to receive a message from a socket while
       using the advanced features of SCTP.  sd is the socket descriptor on which the message pointed to by  msg
       of length len is received.

       If  from  is  not  NULL, the source address of the message is filled in. The argument fromlen is a value-
       result parameter. initialized to the size of the buffer associated with from , and modified on return  to
       indicate the actual size of the address stored.

       sinfo is a pointer to a sctp_sndrcvinfo structure to be filled upon receipt of the message.  msg_flags is
       a pointer to a integer that is filled with any message flags like MSG_NOTIFICATION or MSG_EOR.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sctp_recvmsg returns the number of bytes received or -1 if an error occurred.
