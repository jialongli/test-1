/*
 *	SCHAR_MIN
 *	This is the minimum value that can be represented by a signed char.
 *	SCHAR_MAX
 *	UCHAR_MAX
 *	These are the maximum values that can be represented by a signed char and
 *	unsigned char, respectively.
 *	CHAR_MIN
 *	This is the minimum value that can be represented by a char. It’s equal to
 *	SCHAR_MIN if char is signed, or zero otherwise.
 *	CHAR_MAX
 *	This is the maximum value that can be represented by a char. It’s equal to
 *	SCHAR_MAX if char is signed, or UCHAR_MAX otherwise.
 *	SHRT_MIN
 *	This is the minimum value that can be represented by a signed short int.
 *	On most machines that the GNU C library runs on, short integers are 16-bit
 *	quantities.
 *	SHRT_MAX
 *	USHRT_MAX
 *	These are the maximum values that can be represented by a signed short int
 *	and unsigned short int, respectively.
 *	INT_MIN
 *	This is the minimum value that can be represented by a signed int. On most
 *	machines that the GNU C system runs on, an int is a 32-bit quantity.
 *	INT_MAX
 *	UINT_MAX
 *	These are the maximum values that can be represented by, respectively, the
 *	type signed int and the type unsigned int.
 *	LONG_MIN
 *	This is the minimum value that can be represented by a signed long int.
 *	On most machines that the GNU C system runs on, long integers are 32-bit
 *	quantities, the same size as int.
 *	LONG_MAX
 *	ULONG_MAX
 *	These are the maximum values that can be represented by a signed long int
 *	and unsigned long int, respectively.
 *	LONG_LONG_MIN
 *	This is the minimum value that can be represented by a signed long long int.
 *	On most machines that the GNU C system runs on, long long integers are 64-
 *	bit quantities.
 *	LONG_LONG_MAX
 *	ULONG_LONG_MAX
 *	These are the maximum values that can be represented by a signed long long
 *	int and unsigned long long int, respectively.
 *	WCHAR_MAX
 *	This is the maximum value that can be represented by a wchar_t. See
 *	Section 6.1 [Introduction to Extended Characters], page 109.
