Make sure linux generic is up to date.

1. sudo -i (change to super user)

2. make

3. ls -l (you should see "myproc.ko")
 
3. insmod myproc.ko (myproc is ran and should create myproc in /proc)

4. dmesg (comment should say proc was create)

5. lsmod (you should see myproc at top of list)

6. ls /proc (you should see "myproc" listed)

7. echo "this is Jia" > /proc/myproc (this will write to myproc file)

8. cat /proc/myproc (this will read myproc file)
