Assignment 1
1. cd New_module (Change directory to folder)

2. Make (enter in make to run makefile)

3.ls -l (should see new_module.ko)

4. sudo insmod new_module.ko (insert into kernel)

5. Dmesg | tail -1 (hello, world! Should display)

6. lsmod (scroll up to top and you should see "new_module" listed in kernel)

7. rmmod new_module (remove module from kernel)

8. dmesg (good bye, world should display)


The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with running a module program in kernel space. When we compile a C++ or a Java program we compile it in the user space.
