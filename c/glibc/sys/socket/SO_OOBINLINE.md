The out-of-band mark applies regardless of whether the receiving process is receiving the out-of-band data inline (the SO_OOBINLINE socket option) or out-of-band (the MSG_OOB flag). One common use of the out-of-band mark is for the receiver to treat all the data as special until the mark is passed.
