PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 - add dup2 action to spawn file actions object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *
              file_actions, int fildes, int newfildes);


DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()  function  shall  add a dup2() action to the object referenced by
       file_actions that shall cause the file descriptor fildes to be  duplicated  as  newfildes  (as  if  dup2(
       fildes, newfildes) had been called) when a new process is spawned using this file actions object.

       A spawn file actions object is as defined in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function shall return zero; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The value specified by fildes or newfildes is negative or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions object.


       The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is invalid.


       It   shall   not   be   considered   an   error   for    the    fildes    argument    passed    to    the
       posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()  function  to specify a file descriptor for which the specified opera‐
       tion could not be performed at the time of the call. Any such error will be detected when the  associated
       file actions object is later used during a posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() operation.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()  function is part of the Spawn option and need not be provided on
       all implementations.

RATIONALE
       Refer to the RATIONALE in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
