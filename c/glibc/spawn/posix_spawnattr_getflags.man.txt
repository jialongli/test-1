POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETFLAGS(3P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETFLAGS(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getflags,  posix_spawnattr_setflags  -  get  and set the spawn-flags attribute of a spawn
       attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getflags(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
              short *restrict flags);
       int posix_spawnattr_setflags(posix_spawnattr_t *attr, short flags);


DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getflags() function shall obtain the value of  the  spawn-flags  attribute  from  the
       attributes object referenced by attr.

       The  posix_spawnattr_setflags() function shall set the spawn-flags attribute in an initialized attributes
       object referenced by attr.

       The spawn-flags attribute is used to indicate which process attributes are  to  be  changed  in  the  new
       process  image  when  invoking posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp(). It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or
       more of the following flags:

       POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK

       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER


       These flags are defined in <spawn.h>. The default value of this attribute shall be as if  no  flags  were
       set.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  posix_spawnattr_getflags()  shall  return  zero and store the value of the
       spawn-flags attribute of attr into the object referenced by the flags parameter; otherwise, an error num‐
       ber shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon  successful  completion,  posix_spawnattr_setflags()  shall  return zero; otherwise, an error number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The posix_spawnattr_setflags() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
