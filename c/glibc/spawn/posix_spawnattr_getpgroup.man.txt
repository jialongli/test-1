POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETPGROUP(3P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETPGROUP(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getpgroup,  posix_spawnattr_setpgroup - get and set the spawn-pgroup attribute of a spawn
       attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getpgroup(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
              pid_t *restrict pgroup);
       int posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(posix_spawnattr_t *attr, pid_t pgroup);


DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() function shall obtain the value of the spawn-pgroup  attribute  from  the
       attributes object referenced by attr.

       The  posix_spawnattr_setpgroup()  function  shall  set  the  spawn-pgroup  attribute  in  an  initialized
       attributes object referenced by attr.

       The spawn-pgroup attribute represents the process group to be joined by the new process image in a  spawn
       operation  (if  POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP  is  set  in the spawn-flags attribute).  The default value of this
       attribute shall be zero.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() shall return zero and  store  the  value  of  the
       spawn-pgroup  attribute  of  attr into the object referenced by the pgroup parameter; otherwise, an error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() shall return zero;  otherwise,  an  error  number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.
