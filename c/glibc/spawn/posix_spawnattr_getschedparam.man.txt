POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSCHEDPARAM(3P)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSCHEDPARAM(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getschedparam, posix_spawnattr_setschedparam - get and set the spawn-schedparam attribute
       of a spawn attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>
       #include <sched.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getschedparam(const posix_spawnattr_t *
              restrict attr, struct sched_param *restrict schedparam);
       int posix_spawnattr_setschedparam(posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
              const struct sched_param *restrict schedparam);


DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() function shall obtain the value  of  the  spawn-schedparam  attribute
       from the attributes object referenced by attr.

       The  posix_spawnattr_setschedparam()  function shall set the spawn-schedparam attribute in an initialized
       attributes object referenced by attr.

       The spawn-schedparam attribute represents the scheduling parameters to be assigned  to  the  new  process
       image in a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER or POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM is set in the spawn-
       flags attribute). The default value of this attribute is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() shall return zero and store the value of  the
       spawn-schedparam  attribute of attr into the object referenced by the schedparam parameter; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() shall return zero; otherwise, an error number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These  functions  are  part  of  the Spawn and Process Scheduling options and need not be provided on all
       implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
