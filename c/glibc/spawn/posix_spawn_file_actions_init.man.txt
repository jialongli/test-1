POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTIONS_DESTROY(3P)        POSIX Programmer's Manual       POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTIONS_DESTROY(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy,  posix_spawn_file_actions_init  -  destroy  and  initialize  spawn file
       actions object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *
              file_actions);
       int posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *
              file_actions);


DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function shall destroy the object referenced by file_actions;  the
       object  becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()
       to set the object referenced by file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file  actions  object
       can  be  reinitialized  using  posix_spawn_file_actions_init();  the results of otherwise referencing the
       object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

       The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function shall initialize the object referenced  by  file_actions  to
       contain no file actions for posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() to perform.

       A spawn file actions object is as defined in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .

       The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions object is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions  shall  return  zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
       returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file actions object.


       The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is invalid.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       Refer to the RATIONALE in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
