POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSCHEDPOLICY(3P)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSCHEDPOLICY(3P)



PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy,  posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy  -  get  and  set  the  spawn-schedpolicy
       attribute of a spawn attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>
       #include <sched.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy(const posix_spawnattr_t *
              restrict attr, int *restrict schedpolicy);
       int posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy(posix_spawnattr_t *attr,
              int schedpolicy);


DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy() function shall obtain the value of the  spawn-schedpolicy  attribute
       from the attributes object referenced by attr.

       The posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy() function shall set the spawn-schedpolicy attribute in an initialized
       attributes object referenced by attr.

       The spawn-schedpolicy attribute represents the scheduling policy to be assigned to the new process  image
       in a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set in the spawn-flags attribute). The default value
       of this attribute is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy() shall return zero and store the value of the
       spawn-schedpolicy  attribute  of attr into the object referenced by the schedpolicy parameter; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy() shall return zero; otherwise, an error  num‐
       ber shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These  functions  are  part  of  the Spawn and Process Scheduling options and need not be provided on all
       implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
