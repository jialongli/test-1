       should be eith CAPNG_DROP to set the capability bit to 0, or CAPNG_ADD to set the capability bit to 1. The oper‐
       ation  is  performed  on  the  capability  set specified in the type parameter. The values are: CAPNG_EFFECTIVE,
       CAPNG_PERMITTED, CAPNG_INHERITABLE, CAPNG_BOUNDING_SET. The values may be or'ed together  to  perform  the  same
       operation  on  multiple sets. The last paramter, capability, is the capability define as given in linux/capabil‐
       ity.h.

       nated with a -1 value.
