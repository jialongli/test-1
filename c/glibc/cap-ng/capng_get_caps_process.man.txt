CAPNG_GET_CAPS_PROCESS(3)                         Libcap-ng API                        CAPNG_GET_CAPS_PROCESS(3)



NAME
       capng_get_caps_process - get the capabilities from a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       int capng_get_caps_process(void);


DESCRIPTION
       capng_get_caps_process  will  get  the capabilities and bounding set of the pid stored inside libcap-ng's
       state table. The default is the pid of the running process. This can be changed by using the capng_setpid
       function.


RETURN VALUE
       This returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.


NOTES
       If  you  are  doing  multi-threaded  programming, calling this function will only get capabilities on the
       calling thread. If you want to get overall capabilities for a multi-threaded process,  you  can  only  do
       that before creating any threads. Afterwards, threads may be able to independantly set capabilities.
