# malloc
Implemented a general-purpose dynamic memory allocator in C that achieves high performance and optimal memory utilization. The allocator was designed using segregated free lists, a best fit policy, coalescing and splitting. To use the dynamic memory allocator, familiar functions can be used, namely, malloc, realloc and free.
